# Basic Regression Models in Machine Learning

This repository contains simple implementations of **linear regression models** in Python.  
It’s designed for beginners who want to understand the basics of regression in machine learning, both from scratch and using libraries like **scikit-learn**.

## 📂 Contents

1. **Single Linear Regression (single feature)**  
   - Implementation of linear regression with one independent variable.  
   - Covers the mathematical intuition and code logic.

2. **Multiple Linear Regression**  
   - Extends the concept to multiple independent variables.  
   - Shows how weights and bias are adjusted.

3. **Practical Linear Regression (using scikit-learn)**  
   - Demonstrates how to build regression models quickly using the `scikit-learn` library.  
   - Includes fitting, prediction, and evaluation.
